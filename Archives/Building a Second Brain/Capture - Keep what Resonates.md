Innovation and impact don't happen by accident or chance. Creativity depends on a creative process.

Knowledge isn't always something "out there" that you have to go out and find. It's everywhere all around you(buried in emails, hidden with files, on your cloud drives.) 
Knowledge capture is about mining the richness of the reading you're already doing and the life you're already living.

A knowledge asset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save time, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experience.

__What not to keep__ - sensitive info, special format files, very large files, Notes needing collaborative edits.

>_"You have to keep a dozen of you favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to se whether it helps. Every once's in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, 'how did he do it? he must be a genius' " - Richard Feynman_

__How to avoid keeping too much (or too little)__ 
Any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed. There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful, or valuable to you. When you realize this, the answer is obvious. You can extract only the most salient, relevant, rich material and save it as a succinct note.

The more economical you can b with the material you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self will have to spend organizing, distilling, and expressing it.

Writer recommends - No more than 10 percent of the original source.

__Capture Criteria__
- Does it inspire me?
- Is it useful?
- Is it Personal?
- Is it Surprising?

Definition of Information - That which surprises you. If not surprised then you already knew it at some level, so why take note of it?

The secret to making reading a habit is to make it effortless and enjoyable.

Besides capturing what resonates with you, it is good idea to capture key information about the source of note, such as original web page address, the title of the price, the author or publisher, the date of publish. It is often useful to capture chapter titles, headings and bullet-point lists, since they add structure to you notes and represent distillation already performed by the author on your behalf.

- [p] __Benefits of Externalizing Thoughts__
- You are much more likely to remember information you've written down in your own words. Known as "_Generation Effect_".
- Functional advantage to putting thoughts into externalized forms" such as speaking or writing, leading to the possibility of new discoveries that might not have been obtained in any other fashion known as "_Detachment Gain_".
- Escape from _Reactivity Loop_ - hamster wheel of urgency, outrage and sensationalism

The moment you first encounter an idea is the worst time to decide what it means. You need to set it aside and gain some objectivity.

Don't worry about whether you're capturing "correctly". There's no right way to do this, and therefore no wrong way. The only way to know whether you're getting the good stuff is to try putting it to use in real life.
