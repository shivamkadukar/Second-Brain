- **Definition**: WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is a standard interface between web server software and web applications written in Python.
    
- **Purpose**:
    
    - Facilitates a universal interface for web applications and frameworks.
    - Decouples web server code from web application code, enhancing modularity and portability.
- **Components**:
    
    - **WSGI Server**: The server side of the interface, which receives a request and sends it to the application.
    - **WSGI Application**: The application side of the interface, which processes the request and returns a response.
- **WSGI Application Callable**:
    
    - A WSGI application is a callable object (usually a function) that accepts two arguments:
        - **environ**: A dictionary containing CGI-like environment variables.
        - **start_response**: A callback function to start the HTTP response.
- **WSGI Middleware**:
    
    - Intermediate layers that can process requests/responses between the server and application.
    - Can be used for tasks such as session management, authentication, or content transformation.
- **WSGI Specification**:
    
    - PEP 333 (Python Enhancement Proposal) initially defined WSGI.
    - PEP 3333 updated it for Python 3 compatibility.
- **Key Concepts**:
    
    - **PEP 333/3333**: Documents that specify WSGI's details.
    - **environ**: Environment dictionary passed to the application, containing request information.
    - **start_response**: A callable used by the application to initiate the response.
- **Example of a Simple WSGI Application**:
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `def simple_app(environ, start_response):     status = '200 OK'     headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8')]     start_response(status, headers)     return [b"Hello, World!"]`
    
- **Usage in Flask**:
    
    - Flask, a popular Python web framework, is built on top of WSGI.
    - Understanding WSGI helps in grasping the internal workings of Flask and creating more advanced web applications.
- **Benefits of WSGI**:
    
    - Interoperability between different web servers and web applications/frameworks.
    - Flexibility in choosing or switching servers and frameworks.
    - Simplifies deployment and scaling of Python web applications.
