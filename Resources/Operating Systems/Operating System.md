1. It manages the hardware and software resources of the system. In c omputers, tablets and smartphones these resources include the [processors](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/microprocessor.htm), [memory](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/computer-memory.htm), disk space and more.
2. It provides a stable, consistent way for applications to deal with the hardware without having to know all the details of the hardware.

### Type - 
- **Real-time operating system** (RTOS) - [Real-time operating systems](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/real-time-operating-system/) are used to control machinery, scientific instruments and industrial systems. An RTOS typically has very little user-interface capability, and no end-user utilities since the system will be a "sealed box" when delivered for use. It is important that an RTOS is [managing the resources of the computer](https://www.ni.com/en-us/innovations/white-papers/07/what-is-a-real-time-operating-system--rtos--.html) so that a particular operation executes in precisely the same amount of time every time it occurs. In a complex machine, having a part move more quickly just because system resources are available may be just as catastrophic as having it not move at all because the system is busy.
- **Single-user, single task** - As the name implies, this operating system is designed to manage the computer so that one user can effectively do [one thing at a time](http://cis2.oc.ctc.edu/oc_apps/Westlund/xbook/xbook.php?unit=01&proc=page&numb=3:0). MS-DOS is a good example of a single-user, single-task operating system.
- **Single-user, multitasking** - This is the type of operating system most people use on their desktop and laptop computers today. Microsoft's Windows and Apple's macOS platforms are both examples of operating systems that lets a single user have several applications in operation at the same time. For example, it's entirely possible for a Windows user to be writing a note in a word processor while downloading a file from the internet and printing the text of an email message.
- **Multiuser** - A multiuser operating system allows many different users to take advantage of a computer's resources simultaneously. The operating system must make sure that the requirements of the various users are balanced, and that each of the programs they are using has sufficient and separate resources so that a problem with one user doesn't affect the entire community of users. Unix, VMS and [mainframe operating systems](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-basic-skills?topic=today-what-is-mainframe-its-style-computing), such as _MVS_, are examples of multiuser operating systems.
- **Distributed** - These operating systems [manage multiple computers](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/txseries/8.2?topic=overview-what-is-distributed-computing) at the same time. Rather than using a single powerful computer to work on large problems, distributed OSes [break it down](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/distributed-computing/) into pieces among many smaller computers. You may find these systems in giant server farms, but [hobbyists](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/octapi) and educators create their own distributed systems too using inexpensive machines and even repurposed gaming consoles.

When you turn on the power to a computer, the first program that runs is usually a set of instructions kept in the computer's firmware called the [boot ROM](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/boot-process-secac71d5623/web). For a typical PC, this can be the [basic input output system](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/bios) (BIOS), or on newer machines, the [unified extensible firmware interface](https://uefi.org/faq) (UEFI). This code examines the system hardware to make sure everything is functioning properly and in the case of UEFI, that the [boot software is legitimate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot) and secure. Once the test has successfully completed, the firmware [continues the boot process](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/boot-loader).

The bootstrap loader, or [boot loader](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/l-linuxboot/), is a small program that has a single function: It loads the operating system into memory and allows it to begin operation. In the most basic form, the bootstrap loader sets up the small driver programs that interface with and control the various hardware subsystems of the computer. It sets up the divisions of memory that hold the operating system, user information and applications. It establishes the data structures that hold the myriad signals, flags and semaphores that are used to communicate within and between the subsystems and applications of the computer. Then it turns control of the computer over to the operating system.

The [operating system's tasks](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/operating-system), in the most general sense, fall into several categories:

- Processor management
- Memory management
- Device management
- Storage management
- Application interface
- User interface
- System security management
