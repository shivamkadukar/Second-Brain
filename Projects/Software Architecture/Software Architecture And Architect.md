The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system, which comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both.

**The architect is concerned with the ‘big picture’ questions of what the project is, how it will look, what its function is, and so on, whereas the designer/engineer is concerned with how to make the architect’s ideas work.** The software architecture is all done before any of the actual coding begins.

**Software design is all about how the software architecture can be implemented into the overall system.** This involves:

- Coding
    
- Using specific design patterns
    
- Choosing classes, interfaces, functions and responsibilities
    
- Working with specific components and modules

software architecture refers to how you organize stuff in the process of creating software. And "stuff" here can refer to:

- **Implementation details** (that is, the folder structure of your repo)
- **Implementation** **design** decisions (Do you use server side or client side rendering? Relational or non-relational databases?)
- The **technologies** you choose (Do you use REST or GraphQl for your API? Python with Django or Node with Express for your back end?)
- **System** **design** decisions (like is your system a monolith or is it divided into microservices?)
- **Infrastructure** decisions (Do you host your software on premise or on a cloud provider?)
