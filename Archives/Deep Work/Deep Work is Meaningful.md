"The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy." - Matthew Crawford.

### A Neurological Argument of Depth

_"Grand Unified Theory"_ of mind :
Like fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology to education, behavrioral economics to family counseling, similarly suggest that the skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.

- ["] Who you are, what you think, feel and do, what you love -- is the sum of what you focus on
      Winifred Gallagher

~~What happens to us(or fails to happen) determines how we feel~~
Our brain instead construct our worldview based on _what we pay attention to_.

### A Psychological Argument for Depth

[[Experience sampling method (ESM)]] by Csikzentmihalyi and Larson

- ["] The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limit in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile - a mental flow state.
	Csikzentmihalyi

Ironically, jobs are actually easer to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work. to concrete and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction.

### A Philosophical Argument of Depth

- ["] The task of a craftsman is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there.
       _All Things Shining_ (Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Kelly)
       
- ["] Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to another programmer they would say, "oh, what's well written code." It's much as if you were writing a poem
      Santiago Gonzalez
      
- ["] We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals
	 _The Pragmatic Programmer_
	 Withing the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmenship... One hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today's civil engineers, while our craftsmenship will still be honored.

Your work is craft, and if you hone ability and apply it with respect and cared, then like the skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life.

You don't need rarified job; you need instead rarified approach to your work.
