- ["] Be regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent and original in your work Gustave Flaubert
Cathedral Effect - When we are in a space with high ceilings, for example -- think of the lofty architecture of classic churches invoke the grandeur of heaven-- we tend to think in more abstract ways. When we are in a room with low ceilings, such as a small workshop we're more likely to think concretely.

Hollywood Model - (for project management) - A project is identified; a team is assembled; it works together for precisely as long as is needed to complete the task; then the team disbands.

One of the biggest temptations with organizing is to get too perfectionistic, treating the process of organizing as an end in itself.

### Organizing by PARA method
- __Projects__: short term efforts in you work or life that you're working on now.
- __Areas__: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.
- __Resources__: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.
- __Archives__: Inactive items from the other three categories.

### Projects: What I'm Working on Right Now
- Has beginning and end, Have specific, clear outcome that needs to happen
- Knowing which projects you're currently committed to is crucial to being able to prioritize your week, plan you r progress, and say no to things that aren't important.

### Areas: What I'm Committed to Over Time
- It's something that we will have to think about and manage, in one way or another, for as long as we live(or it does not have a end date yet)
- There is no goal to reach, but there is a _standard_ that you want to uphold in each area
Examples of areas from personal life:
	- Activities or place you are responsible for, people you are responsible for or accountable to, Standard of performance you are responsible for(Health, Personal growth, friendship, finance)
In job or business:
	- Dept or functions you are responsible for, people or teams you are responsible for or accountable to, Standards of performance you are responsible for(professional development, recruiting and hiring, etc.)

### Resources: Things I want to reference in the Future
- Anything that doesn't belong to a project or an area and could include any topic you're interested in gathering information about
For example-
- what topics are you interested in?
- what subjects are you researching?
- What useful information do you want to be able to reference?
- What hobbies or passions do you have?

### Archives: Things I've Completed or put on hold
- The archives are an important part of PARA because they allow you to place a folder in "cold storage" so that it doesn't clutter your workspace, while safekeeping it forever just in case you need it.
For example:
- Project that are completed or canceled.
- area of responsibility that you are no longer committed to maintaining
- Resources that are no longer relevant( hobbies you lose interest in or subject you no longer care about)

### How to decide where to save individual notes?
- The moment you first capture an idea is the worst time to try to decide what it relates to. First, because you've encountered it and haven't had any time to ponder its ultimate purpose; because forcing yourself to make decision every you capture something adds a lot of friction to the process. This make the experience mentally taxing and thus less likely to happen in first place.
- "keeping what resonates" in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term.
- Knowledge is best applied through execution, which mean whatever doesn't help you make progress on your projects is probably detracting from them.











- Instead of organizing ideas according to _where they come from_, organizing them according to _where they are going_ -- specifically, the outcomes that they can help you realize.
- People need clear workspaces to be able to create. We cannot do our best thinking and our best work when all the "stuff" from the past is crowding and cluttering our space.
