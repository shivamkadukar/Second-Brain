  
• Union filesystems, also known as UnionFS, are crucial in Docker's functionality.  
• They create a virtual, layered file structure by overlaying multiple directories.  
• UnionFS allows simultaneous mounting of multiple directories on a single mount point while keeping their contents separate.  
• Key features include:  
- Layered Structure: The system builds a layered structure consisting of multiple read-only layers and a top writable layer.  
- Copy-on-Write: The system creates a copy of the file in the writable layer, leaving the original file in the read-only layer untouched.  
- Resource Sharing: Union filesystems allow multiple containers to share common base layers while running separately.  
- Fast Container Initialization: Union filesystems allow instant creation of new containers by creating a new writable layer on existing read-only layers.
