- Reduces password fatigue and increases security

### Multi-Factor Authentication ([MFA](https://workos.com/blog/what-is-mfa-and-why-does-your-app-need-it))

- Adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords
- Common methods: SMS, authenticator apps, biometric data

### Session Management

- Maintains user state across requests
- Techniques: cookies, tokens, and server-based sessions

### Bot Protection

- Prevents automated abuse of applications
- Methods: CAPTCHA, rate limiting, and behavior analysis

### Organizational Authentication Policies

- Customizable authentication rules for different organizations
- Allows flexibility and adherence to specific security requirements

### User Interface Considerations

- Designing intuitive and user-friendly authentication flows
- Importance of error messages and accessibility

### Email Verification

- Ensures email ownership and improves security
- Common implementation: verification links or codes

### Identity Linking

- Merges multiple user accounts across services into a single identity
- Benefits: streamlined user experience and data consistency

### Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning

- Creates user accounts on-the-fly during the authentication process
- Reduces administrative overhead and simplifies onboarding
