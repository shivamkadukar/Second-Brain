Docker allows you to create isolated, disposable environments that can be deleted once you’re done with testing. This makes it much easier to work with third party software, test different dependencies or versions, and quickly experiment without the risk of damaging your local setup.

## Creating an Interactive Test Environment with Docker

To demonstrate how to setup an interactive test environment, let’s use the Python programming language as an example. We will use a public Python image available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/python).

- To start an interactive test environment using the Python image, simply run the following command:

```
docker run -it --rm python
```

Here, `-it` flag ensures that you’re running the container in interactive mode with a tty, and `--rm` flag will remove the container once it is stopped.

- You should now be inside an interactive Python shell within the container. You can execute any Python command or install additional packages using `pip` as you normally would.

```
print("Hello, Docker!")
```

- Once you are done with your interactive session, you can simply type `exit()` or press `CTRL+D` to exit the container. The container will be automatically removed as specified by the `--rm` flag.
