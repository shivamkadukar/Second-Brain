> Getting a good medical cover is probably more important than buying life insurance -- you're more likely to go to hospital with an illness or accident than die.

__Do I need cover? My office covers me__
Buy your own policy even if you are covered by your office, especially if your in your forties.

The need for personal cover comes and stands in front of you when suddenly you are faced with a change in circumstances. The other time you see reality biting is at retirement. Along with your farewell party, you bid farewell to your medical cover from work. Getting a cover at age sixty is difficult.

If you are covered by the government or any other agency, event post retirement, like army and governments officials are, you don't need medical cover.

__How much do  I need__
You need basic cover of 3-15lakhs per person. For a nuclear family it makes sense to get a product called a 'family floater' that allows the insurance cover to whichever member of the family that needs it.

__What policy do i buy__
Price 
- How does the price compare with policies from other companies right now and how does the price compare over the years?
- Your policy may cost the leas today but may become the most expensive when you hit age sixty or seventy. If you are buying from an agent, ask him to show you the price comparison at ten-year differences. If you are forty, ask for the price of the policy as it is today when sold to fifty, sixty and seventy year old.

Benefits
 - Ensure that you have a policy that does not have something called a 'co-pay' clause. THis is called co-pay because you agree to pay certain percentage of a bill to share the costs with the insurance company.
 - Check for a 'pre-existing' disease clause. check to see how long the waiting period is in the policy you shortlist. 
 - Check if your policy has a 'disease waiting period'. 
 - Check if your policy has 'sub limits'. A sub limit is a limitation on what the company will pay out for specific things. Usually sub limit on room rent. Look for policy with no-sub limits.
 - Check for exclusions. list of diseases which the policy do not cover.
 - Ask how much of the costs before and after hospitalization the policy will cover.
 - Ask for a list of 'day-care' procedures that don't need you to stay for twenty-fours hours in a hospital any more.
	 - Check the details of the day-care clause, what will be covered, how much will be paid and how long you have to stay to claim.
 - Look at the 'no-claims bonus' feature

Claims
- How many claims does the company settle? out of 100, if the company's claims history does not settle more than 95 claims, don't buy from the firm.
- Look at the claim complaints data and look for a policy that has less than thirty complaints on every 10k claims made.
