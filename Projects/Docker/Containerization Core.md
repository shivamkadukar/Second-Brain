### Docker Core Technologies Overview  
  
• Linux Containers (LXC): A lightweight virtualization solution that allows multiple isolated Linux systems to run on a single host.  
• [[Control Groups]] (cgroups): A Linux kernel feature that allows resource allocation and management to a set of processes.  
• [[Union File Systems]] (UnionFS): A file system service that overlays multiple file systems in a single view.  
• [[Namespaces]]: A Linux kernel feature that provides process isolation, allowing Docker to create isolated workspaces called containers.  
• Types of namespaces include PID, NET, MNT, and USER, each responsible for isolating a different aspect of a process.
