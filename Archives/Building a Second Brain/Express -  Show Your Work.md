### Intermediate Packets: Power of thinking small

- If you're stuck on a task, break it down into smaller steps.
- We stand on the shoulders of giants, and it's smart to build on the thinking they've done rather than try to reinvent the wheel.

__Benefits of working in terms of Intermediate Packets__
- You'll become interruption proof because you are focusing only on one small packet at a time. You become less vulnerable to interruptions, because you're not trying to manage all the work-in-process in your head.
- You'll be able to make progress in any span of time. Instead of waiting until you have multiple uninterrupted hours-- which is rare and getting rarer-- you can look at how many minutes you have free and choose to work on an IP that you can get done within that time. Big projects and goals become less intimidating because you can just keep breaking them down into smaller pieces, until they fit right into the gaps in your day.
- IPs increase the quality of your work by allowing you to collect feedback more often.
- You can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created IPs. This is magical experience that will completely change how you view productivity. The idea of starting anything from scratch will become foreign to you.

- You're second brain is the repository of things you are already creating and using anyway. All we are doing is adding a little bit of structure and intentionality to how we use them: capturing them in one place, so we can find them with a search; organizing them according to our projects, so we have a dedicated place for each important aspect of our lives; and distilling them down to their most essential points, so they can be quickly accessed and retrieved.






### How to Resurface and Reuse your past work
- There are some of the most valuable connections - when an idea crosses the boundaries between subjects. They can't be planned or predicted. They can emerge only when many kinds of ideas in different shapes and sizes are mixed together.

__Four Retrieval Methods__
1. Search
2. Browsing
	- ["] We humans are far better and more experienced at spatial thinking than at abstract thinking. Abstract thought can be difficult in and of itself, but fortunately it can often be mapped onto spatial thought in one way or another. That way, spatial thinking can substitute for and scaffold abstract thought". - Barbara Tversky, [[Psychology]] Professor
3. Tags

4. Serendipity
	- While using previous retrieval methods, it is a good idea to keep your focus a little broad. Don't begin and end your search with only the specific folder that matches your criteria. Make sure to look through related categories, such as similar projects, relevant areas, and different kinds of resources.
	- Serendipity is amplified by visual patterns. We intuitively absorb colors and shapes in the blinks of an eye, using far less energy than it takes to read words.
	- Sharing our ideas with others introduces a major element of serendipity, they might point out aspects of an idea you never considered, suggest looking at source your never knew existed, or contribute their own ideas to make it better.


### Three stages of expressing:
 What does it look like to show our work?
__Remember: Retrieve an Idea Exactly When Needed__
- Withing days of capturing ideas that resonate with you, you'll start to notice opportunities to share them with others to their benefit.
__Connect: Use Notes to tell a bigger story__
- Creative expression isn't always about self-promotion or advancing our own career. Some of our most beautiful, creative acts are ones in which we connect the dots for others in way they wouldn't be able to do themselves.
__Create: Complete projects and accomplish goals stress free__




### Creativity is Inherently Collaborative
It is much easier to show someone a small thing, and ask for their thoughts on it, rather than the entire opus you're creating. It's less confronting to hear criticism on one small aspect of your work, at an early stage when you still have time to correct it, than getting a negative reaction after months of effort.




Instead of thinking of your job in terms of _tasks_, which always require you to be there, personally doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of _assets_ and _building blocks_ that you can assemble.

To truly "know" something, it's not enough to read about it in a book. Ideas are merely thoughts until you put them into action.

You have to value your ideas to share them. You have to believe that the smallest idea has the potential to change people's lives.
