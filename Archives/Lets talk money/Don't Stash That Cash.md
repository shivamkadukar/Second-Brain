 __Summary__
- Three accounts system separating income, spending and savings.
- spending on living cost no more than 45-50 per cent of take home income.
- EMI payouts no more than 25-30 percent of take home income.
- savings are at least 15-20 per cent of take home income

The goal is to separate out money according to its function so that the brain is better able to map it. Three boxes for the three functions of money. THese are income, spending and saving. If we can separate the money into these three boxes each month, we'll be in better control.

Three accounts 
- Income account
- Spend-it account
- Invest-it account
Identify your monthly expenses, move money to 'spend-it' on the salary day. Move money to be invested, saved to 'invest-it'

In case of spouse,
	-The spend-it account is a joint account into which both credit equal amounts for the monthly spending.
	- each partners has his and her invest-it account in different banks. These can be joint, but the primary holder should be ideally be the person in whose name the investment will happen.
	
> Moving money from invest-it to spend-it is not allowed.
