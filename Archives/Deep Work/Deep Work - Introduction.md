__Deep Work__ : Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentraton that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. THese efforsts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Opposite is shallow work.

- ["] What the net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation.     _Nicholas Carr_

Networks tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.

Our work culture's shift toward the shallow (whether you think it's philosophically good or bad) is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth.

To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you're capable of producing -- a task that requires depth.

__The Deep Work Hypothesis__: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
