An __emergent, ordered__ list of __what is needed__ to improve the product.

>[Epics](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics) are a way for us to briefly describe the product features.
> [User Stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) are notation to describe small refined Product Backlog items.


- Only one product backlog per product/project.
- Product Backlog is dynamic
- Backlog items contains a description.

### Ordering Product Backlog
[Project management Frameworks](https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-management-frameworks/)
- KANO Model - 
![[KANO model.png|500]]
	- KANO divides features into three categories, mandatory, linear(additional features), exciter.
	- all the mandatory features must be included in the Product Backlog.
	- should include as many linear features as possible. However, you should leave a little room for your exciters.
	- When to use-
		- Limted Time, Limited Resources, Minimum feature, "WoW" feature, Performance enchancing features.

### Estimation/ Sizing

 Scrum does not prescribe any rules about estimate
 Commonly used measure unit is Story Point(agile alternative to hours and days).
 Most commonly used estimation technique is planning poker.
-  [__Story Point__](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation)
	Story points are units of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work. 
	Teams assign story points relative to work complexity, the amount of work, and risk or uncertainty.
	Values are assigned to more effectively break down work into smaller pieces, so they can address uncertainty.
	Over time, this helps teams understand how much they can achieve in a period of time and builds consensus and commitment to the solution.  It may sound counter-intuitive, but this abstraction is actually helpful because it pushes the team to make tougher decisions around the difficulty of work

- [__Planning Poker__](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/scrum-poker-for-agile-projects)
	Scrum poker, also known as “planning poker” and “pointing poker”, is a gamified technique that development teams use to guess the effort of project management tasks.
	These estimations are based on the entire group’s input and consensus, making them more engaging and accurate than other methods. To help gauge the number of story points for the relevant tasks, teams use planning poker cards, which are similar to poker cards.
	- Step 1: hand out the cards to participants
	- Step 2: Read the user story out loud
	- Step 3: Discuss the story
		-  How should we handle the work?
		- How many people are expected to get involved?
		- What skills will be needed to work on the story?
		- How should we tackle any roadblocks that delay progress?
	- Select and share
		- Usually, it’s used to show an estimate of story points (but can also be used to represent the number of ideal days.
	- Reach a consensus 
 
__Backlog Refinement__
- act of breaking down and further defining product backlog items into smaller more precise items
- enables getting the product backlog items ready
- [[Scrum Team]] decides __how__ and __when__ refinement is done.

__Definition of Ready__ (_Optional for implementation_)
- set of acceptance criteria which decide if a product backlog is ready to use.
- The product backlog is ready when, 
		Acceptance criteria is defined
		Team understands what is needed to be done
		It fits in a sprint.
