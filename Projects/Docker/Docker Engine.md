[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:

- A server with a long-running daemon process [`dockerd`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/dockerd).
- APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
- A command line interface (CLI) client [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/).
