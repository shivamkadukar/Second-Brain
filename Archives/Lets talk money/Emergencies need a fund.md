__How much do you need__
- Six months to two years living costs in an emergency fund.
- Double-income family with no dependent parents or child - three months of living expenses.
- Single income family with dependent parents or child - 1 year of living costs in emergency fund.
- You are in your 50s - 2 years of living expenses in emergency fund.

Set yourself a monthly target for your emergency fund and keep crediting your emergency account each month. Once you get to your target, stop funding it.

__Where do you keep this money__
The worst thing you can do is leave this money sloshing around in your savings deposit. You need to move it to a place that is not easy to access, but yet is liquid enough to be of use when you want it and gives a return that is better than a savings deposit.

Set up an FD with your emergency money in it. If your banking with a bank that allows flexi-FDs that allow you to sweep out just the amount you need, rather than breaking the entire deposit, go for that.

Emergency fund should sit in fixed deposits or very safe debt funds.
