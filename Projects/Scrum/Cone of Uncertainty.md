At the beginning of the project, comparatively little is known about the product.
As a result, estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and have larger variability.
As more research and development is done, more is learned about the product.
Thus, the uncertainty tends to decrease, reaching zero, which usually happens by the end of the product development cycle.

```
Worst case - Variability x Initial Estimate
Best case - Variability / Initial Estimate
```


In the software industry, it has been shown that initially, the estimates may be off by a factor of four, which means that the actual effort can be four times or one-fourth of the initial estimates, represented here by 0.25.
	The more volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous(VUCA) is the business and technology environment, the higher the variability factor.

 | Factor      | Meaning                                                                                | Effect                                                                                                                        |     |
 | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
 | Volatility  | the level of changes in the environment.                                               | The more changes, the higher the volatility.                                                                                  |     |
 | Uncertainty | how much we know about the situation.                                                  |                                                                                                                               |     |
 | Complexity  | the level of interconnectivity and interdependence of multiple components in a system. | The more business rules and technological dependencies, the more complex.                                                     |     |
 | Ambiguous   | the level at which we understand the meaning of something                              | In environments with high ambiguity, we need to assume an answer so that we can move forward despite not being sure about it. |     |

__The higher the variability, the greater need to be agile.__

Short delivery cycles can reduce the variability in estimates from 300% to 60%, which is a significant improvement!

Agility( being [[Agile]]) is a way of dealing VUCA.
