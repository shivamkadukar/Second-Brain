In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.

### How to become a winner in the new economy
__Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy__
- The ability to quickly master hard things.
- The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

_If you can't learn, you can't thrive._

Producing at an elite level. If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient. You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value.

_If you don't produce, you won't thrive -- no matter how skilled or talented you are._

How does one cultivate htes core abilities? It's here tath we arrive at the central thesis of this book: THe two core abilities just decribed depend on you ability to perform deep work.

### Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things
What does deliberate practice actually requires
- your attentionis focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or an idea you're trying to master
- you recieve feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it's most productive.

To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an acto of deep work. If you're comfortable going deep, you'll be comfortable mastering the increasing complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy.

High Quality work produced = time spent x intensity of focus

To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periofs with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. If you'r not comfortable going deep for extended perios of time, it'll be difficult to get your performance to the peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly necessary to thrive professionally. Unless your talent and skills absolutely dwarf those of your competition, the deep workers among them will outproduce you.

Deep work is not the only skill valuable in our economy, and it's possible to do well without fostering this ability, but the niches where this is advisable are increasingly rare.
