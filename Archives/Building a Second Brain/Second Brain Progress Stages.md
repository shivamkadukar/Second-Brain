- __Remember__
	Using digital notes to save facts and ideas that you would have trouble recalling otherwise: takeaways from meetings, quotes from interviews or the details of a project.
- __Connect__
	Second Brain evolves from being primarily a memory tool to becoming _thinking tool_. A piece of advice from a mentor comes in handy as they encounter a similar situation on a different team.
