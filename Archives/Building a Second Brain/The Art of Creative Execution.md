- ["] Creative products are always shiny and new; the creative process is ancient and unchanging.

By the time you sit down to make progress on something, all the work to gather and organize the source material needs to already be done. (Opinion - Before u sit to study, what to study and from where should already be clear.)

All the step of [[The CODE Method]] are designed to do one thing; to help you put your digital tools to work for you so that your human fallible, endlessly creative first brain can do what it does best. _Imagine. Invent. Innovate. Create_

Building a second brain is really about standardizing the way we work, because we only really improve when we standardize the way we do something.

### Divergence and Convergence: A Creative balancing act

The first two step of CODE, Capture and Organize, make up divergence. They are about gathering seeds of imagination carried on the wind and storing them in a secure place. This is where you research, explore, and add ideas. The final two steps, Distill and Express, are about convergence. They help us shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new out of the knowledge building blocks we've assembled.

### The Three Strategies to Bring Creative Work Together
When you sit down to finish something - it can be so tempting to do more research. It's so easy to open up dozens of browser tabs, order more books, or go of in completely new directions. Those actions are tempting because they feel like productivity. They feel like forward progress, when in fact they are divergent acts that postpone the moment of completion.

__The Archipelago of Ideas: Give yourself stepping-stones__
It is a contemporary reinvention of the age-old practice of outlining--laying out the points you want to include up front, so that when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together.

It separates the tow activities your brain has the most difficulty performing at the same time: choosing ideas (know as selection) and arranging them into a logical flow (known as sequencing).

Instead of starting with scarcity, start with abundance-- the abundance of interseting insights you've collected in your Second Brain.

__The Hemingway Bridge: Use yesterday's momentum today__
Hemingway Bridge - end with beginning in mind.
Instead of burning through every last ounce of energy at the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to write down some of the following kinds of things in your digital notes:
- Write down ideas for next steps
- write down the current status
- write down any details you have in midns that are likely to be forgotten once you step away
- Write out your intention for the next work session.

__Dial Down the Scope: Ship Something small and concrete__
The chicken-and-egg problem of creativity: you don't know what you should create, but you can't discover what people want until you create something. 

Dialing down the scope is a way of short-circuiting that paradox and testing the waters with some-thing small and concrete, while still protecting the fragile and tentative edges of your work.

Divergence and convergence are not a linear path, but loop: once you complete one round of convergence, you can take what you've learned right back into a new cycle of divergence. Keep alternating back and forth, making iterations each time until it's something you can consider "done" or "complete" and share more widely.
