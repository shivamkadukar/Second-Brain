### The Mise-en-Place way to sustainable productivity

Mise en place , a culinary philosophy used in restaurants around the word. Chefs can never afford to stop the whole kitchen just so they can clean up.  They learn to keep their workspace clean and organized in the flow of the meals they are preparing.

We tend to notice our systems need maintenance only when they break down, which we then blame on our lack of self-discipline or our failure to be sufficiently productive.

The three habits most important to second-brain includes:
- Project checklists
- Weekly and Monthly reviews
- Noticing Habits

### The project checklist habit - the key to starting your knowledge flywheel

What most people are missing, is a feedback loop -- a way to "recycle" the knowledge that was created as part of past efforts so it can be used in future as well.

There are two key moments in this process of recycling knowledge. Two places where the paths diverge, and you have the chance to do something different than you've done before

__Checklist #1: Project Kickoff__
1. _Capture_ my current thinking on the project
2. _Review_ folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes
3. _Search_ for related terms across all folders.
4. _Move_ relevant notes to the project folder
5.  _Create_ an outline of collect notes and plan the project
	The important thing to remember as you move through this checklist is that you are making a plan for how to tackle the project, not executing the project itself. You should think of this five-step checklist as a first pass, taking no more than 20 to 30 minutes.
Other options for actions to add in checklist
- Answer premortem questions - what do you want to learn? what is the greatest source of uncertainty or most imp question you want to answer? what is most likely to fail?
- Communicate with stakeholders 
- Define success criteria
- Have a official kickoff

__Checklist #2: Project Completion__
1. _Mark_ project as complete in task manager or project management app
2. _Cross out_ the associated project goal and move to "completed" section
3. _Review_ intermediate packets and move them to other folders
4. _Move_ project to archives across all platforms
5. _If project is becoming inactive_ add current status note to the project folder before archiving

Other options for actions to add in checklist
- Answer postmortem questions - 
- Communicate with stakeholders
- Evaluate success criteria
- officially close out the project and celebrate


### The Review Habit
__A weekly review: Reset to Avoid Overwhelm__
Author's checklist-

__A Monthly review: Reflect for clarity and control__
Author's checklist-
review and update goals, review and update project list, review areas of responsibility, review someday/maybe tasks, reprioritize tasks.




### The Noticing Habits: Using second-brain to engineer luck
"Noticing" Habits -- taking advantage of small opportunities you notice to capture something you might otherwise skip over or to make a note more actionable or discoverable.

It is crucial to stay organized, but it needs to be done a little at a time in the flow of our normal lives. It needs to be done in the in-between moments of moving your porjcts forward as you notice small opportunities for improvement.

Just like professional chefs keep their environment organized with small nudges and adjustments, you can use noticing habits to "organize as you go".

We have to remember that we are not building an encyclopedia of immaculately organized knowledge. We are building a working system, Both in the sense that it must work, and in the sense that it is a regular part of our everyday lives. For that reason, you should prefer a system that is imperfect, but that continues to be useful in the real conditions of you life.
