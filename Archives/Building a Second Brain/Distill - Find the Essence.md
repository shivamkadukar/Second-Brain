- ["] To attain knowledge, add thinks every day. To attain wisdom, remove things every day.
	Lao Tzu
- ["] You truly never know where inspiration will come from and the extraordinary impact it can have

- Key ideas that catches our attention in the moment, that could change our life forever, starts to fade from our memory after a few hours or days or weeks
- You job as a notetaker is to preserver the notes you're taking on the thing you discover in such a way that they can survive the journey into the future. That way your excitement and enthusiasm for you knowledge builds over time instead of fading away.

### Discoverability - The missing link in making notes useful
- Imagine yourself as demanding customer. Each is note is like a product you are creating for the benefit of that future customer. If they don't but it -- they don't think it's worth the effort of revisiting past notes -- then all the value of the work you're doing now will be lost.
- Distillation is at the very heart of all effect ve communication. The more important it is that your audience hear and take action on your message, the more distilled that message needs to be. The details and subtleties can come later once you have your audience's attention.


### The progressive summarization technique
Alternative to [[Active Ideation]]
- you highlight the main points of note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several __layers__.
- Layers
	1. Captured Notes
	2. Bolded passages
	3. Highlighted passages
	4. Executive Summary
- With progressive summarization , you are building up a map of the best ideas in you second brain.
- The multiple layers of it are like a safety net; if you go in the wrong direction, or make a mistake in highlighting, you can always go back to the original version and try again. Nothing gets forgotten or deleted.
- This technique is immensely useful from notes from our own conversations. Often your own thoughts need some distillation before you can take action on them.
- It is not a method for remembering as much as possible -- it is a method for forgetting as much as possible. As you distill your ideas, they naturally improve, because when you drop the merely good parts, the great parts can shine more brightly. To be clear it takes skill and courage to let the details fall away.
- We inevitably have to make decisions about what to throw away. You cannot highlight the main takeaways from an article without leaving some points out.

### Common Mistakes of Novice notetakers
- __Over - Highlighting__
	- When it comes to notetaking for work, less is more.
	- Rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should no more than 10-20 percent of the previous layer.
- __Highlighting without a purpose in mind__
	- The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you "touch" a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for you future self --[[Stigmergy]]
	- __Campsite rule__ - Leave it better than you found it. This ensures that the notes you interact with most often will naturally become the most discoverable in a virtuous cycle.
- __Making Highlighting Difficult__
	- Find what resonates

- Our most scarce resource is time, which means we need to prioritize our ability to quickly rediscover the ideas that we already have in our second brain.
- When the opportunity arrives to do our best work, it not the time to start reading books and doing research. You need that research to already be done.

- Each time you decide to add a highlight, you are developing your judgment: distinguishing the bits that truly matter from those that don't. This is a skill you can become better at over time. The more you exercise your judgment, the more efficient and enjoyable your notetaking will become because you know that every minute of attention you invest is creating lasting value. There are few things more satisfying than the feeling of making consistent progress.
