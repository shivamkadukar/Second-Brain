**Load Balancer**:

- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance, reliability, and scalability.
- Works at the network layer and routes requests based on factors like server availability and response time.

**Reverse Proxy**:

- Acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers.
- Enhances security by hiding server identities, providing SSL termination, and offering features like caching and web application firewall (WAF).
- Operates at the application layer and handles outgoing traffic from clients to servers.

**Key Differences**:

- Load balancers distribute incoming traffic, while reverse proxies handle outgoing traffic.
- Load balancers focus on traffic distribution and scalability, while reverse proxies provide additional features and security enhancements.
- Load balancers operate at the network layer, while reverse proxies work at the application layer.


#### Layer 4 Load Balancing:

- Operates at the transport layer (Layer 4).
- Routes traffic based on network and transport layer protocols., Routes traffic based on IP addresses and ports.
- Utilizes algorithms like Round Robin and Least Connections.
- Suitable for simple routing decisions without inspecting packet content.

#### Layer 7 Load Balancing:

- Operates at the application layer (Layer 7).
- Analyzes application-level data like HTTP headers and cookies.
- Enables advanced features such as content-based routing and SSL termination.
	- Understands things like website addresses and cookies.
	- Can do advanced tasks like directing traffic based on website content.
- Ideal for applications requiring application-specific routing decisions and advanced traffic management.
