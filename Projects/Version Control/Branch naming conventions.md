A git branch should start with a category. Pick one of these: `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, or `test`.

- `feature` is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
- `bugfix` is for fixing a bug
- `hotfix` is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)
- `test` is for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket

Branch Naming Pattern
```bash
git branch <category/reference/description-in-kebab-case>
```

> Reference - the task ticket number from the sprint board

> Kebab Case: use of `-` instead of space `-` in between words
