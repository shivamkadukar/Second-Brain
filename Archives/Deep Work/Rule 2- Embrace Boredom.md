- ["] You cannot consider yourself fulfilling your daily obligations unless you have stretched to the reaches of your mental capacity.

The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.

Efforts tot depend your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction. Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside of their training sessions. you'll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.

If every moment of potential boredom in your life -- say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives -- is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the "mental wrecks" in Nass's research it's not ready for deep work -- even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.

### Don't take breaks form distraction instead take breaks from focus

Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction.

Schedule in advance when you'll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times.

1. This strategy works even if your job requires lots of internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.
2. Regardless of how you schedule your internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from internet use.
3. Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.

To simply wait and be bored has a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it's incredibly valuable.

To succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn't mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it's sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention.





### Work like Teddy Roosevelt

Identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that's high on your priority list. Estimate how long you'd normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time.

At this point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep tasks done in time: _working with great intensity._

Deep work requires level of concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable.

### Mediate Productively

The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you're occupied physically but not mentally -- walking, jogging, driving, showering -- and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem.

By forcing you to resist distraction and return your attention repeatedly to a well defined problem, it helps strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles, and by forcing you to push your focus deeper and deeper on a single problem, it sharpens your concentration.

__Suggestion #1: Be Way of Distractions and looping__

When you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back.

You must be on your guard for looping, as it can quickly subvert an entire productive meditation session. When you notice it, remark to yourself that you seem to be in a loop, then redirect your attention toward the next step.

__Suggestion #2: Structure your deep thinking__

It helps to have some structure for this deep thinking process. I suggest starting with a careful review of the relevant variables for solving the problem and then storing these values in your working memory.

Once the relevant variables are identified, define the specific next-step question you need to answer using these variables.

Assuming you're able to solve your next-step question, the final step of this structured approach to deep thinking is to consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified. at this point, you can push yourself to the next level of depth by starting the process over.



### Memorize a Deck of Cards
Attention control - Measures the subjects ability to maintain their focus on essential information.

Professional memory athletes never attempt rote memorization, that is, where you simply look at information again and again, repeating it in your head. This approach to retention, though popular among burned-out students, misunderstands how our brain works. We're not wired to quickly internalize abstract information. We are, however, really good at remembering scenes.
