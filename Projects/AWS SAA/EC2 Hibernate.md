- We know we can stop, terminate instances 
	- __Stop__ – the data on disk (EBS) is kept intact in the next start 
	- __Terminate__ – any EBS volumes (root) also set-up to be destroyed is lost 
- On start, the following happens: 
	- First start: the OS boots & the EC2 User Data script is run 
	- Following starts: the OS boots up • Then your application starts, caches get warmed up, and that can take time!

- With EC2 Hibernate- 
	- The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved 
	- The instance boot is much faster! (the OS is not stopped / restarted) 
	- Under the hood: 
		- the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume 
		- The root EBS volume must be encrypted 
	- Use cases: Long-running processing, Saving the RAM state, Services that take time to initialize
