With Deployments you can easily edit any field/property of the POD template. Since the pod template is a child of the deployment specification,Â  with every change the deployment will automatically delete and create a new pod with the new changes. So if you are asked to edit a property of a POD part of a deployment you may do that simply by running the command

```bash
kubectl edit deployment my-deployment
```
