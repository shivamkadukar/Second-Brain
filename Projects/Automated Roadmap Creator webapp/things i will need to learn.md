Force Layouts: Specifically, how to create and manipulate force-directed graphs for node-link diagrams.
4. Integrating D3.js with React
Using D3.js within React Components: Understanding how to use D3 within React's component lifecycle and manage SVG elements.
Handling Updates: Ensuring D3 updates properly when React re-renders components.
5. JSON
