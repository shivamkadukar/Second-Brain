- The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers.
-  The **Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned**. It should have enough detail that they can **inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum**.
- Selected PBIs and plan can only be changed by development team(if the work turns out to be something different than expected) after consulting with Product Owner.
- If someone else want to change it, they need to consult with the product owner and then product owner negotiate it with the development team.

#### Commitment: Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, **it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it.** The Sprint Goal also creates **coherence and focus**, encouraging the **Scrum Team to work together** rather than on separate initiatives.

**If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.**
