### Mindset Over Toolset - The quest for the perfect app
It is never a person's toolset that constraints their potential, it's their mindset.

Our attitude toward information profoundly shapes how we see and understand the world and our place in it. Our success in the workforce depends on our ability to make use of information more effectively and to think better, smarter, faster.

### Giving your first brain a new Job
Instead of trying to optimize your mind so that it can manage every tiny detail of your life. it's time to fire your biological brain from that job and give it a new one: as the CEO of your life, orchestrating and managing the process of turning information into results.

Emptying ourselves of our jumble of thoughts requires courage, because without our thoughts as distractions, we are left to sit with uncomfortable questions about our future and our purpose.

### The shift from scarcity to abundance
Abundance mindset tells us that there is an endless amount of incredibly powerful knowledge everywhere we look -- in the content we consume, in our social network, in our bodies and intuitions, and in our own minds. It also tells us that we don't need to consume or understand all of it, or even much of it. All we need is a few seeds of wisdom, and the seeds we most need tend to continually find us again and again. You don't need to go out and hunt down insights. All you have to do is listen to what life is repeatedly trying to tell you. Life tends to surface exactly what we need to know, whether we like it or not. Like a compassionate but unyielding teacher, reality doesn't bend or cave to our will. It patiently teaches in what ways our thinking is not accurate, and those lessons tend to show up across our lives again and again

Making shift to a mindset of abundance is about letting go of the things we thought we needed to survive but that no longer serve us. It means giving up low-value work that gives us a false sense of security but that doesn't call forth our highest selves. Its about letting go of low-value information that seems important, but that doesn't make us better people. It's about putting down the protective shield of fear that tells us we need to protect ourselves from the opinions of others, because that same shield is keeping us from receiving the gifts they want to give us.

### The shift from obligation to service
"Your singular perspective may patch some small hole in the vast tattered fabric of humanity". Ryder Carroll.

### The shift from consuming to creating
Polanyi's paradox - We know more than we can say

There are many tasks we can easily perform as human that we can't fully explain. For ex, driving a car or recognizing a face. We can try to describe how we do these things, bu our explanantions always fall far short. That's because we are relying on _tacit knowledge_, but it resides in our subconscious and muscle memory where language cannot reach.
