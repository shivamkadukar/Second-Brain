A mechanism to guide changes. Scrum is a framework that you can use as a foundation to work on complex problems.

**Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems**.

In a nutshell, Scrum **requires a Scrum Master** to foster an environment where:

1. A **Product Owner orders the work** for a complex problem into a **Product Backlog**.
    
2. The **Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment** of value during a Sprint.
    
3. The **Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust** for the next Sprint.
    
4. _Repeat_

Succeeding with agile and scrum requires being rapid and lean(**Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials**.)

Scrum is **built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it**.

## Scrum Empiricism
- __Transparency__ -
	- transparency is about __having a common standard so that all the observers share a common understanding__ of what is being seen. The significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
	- Team need to know what is going on and know how to contribute to the system or to the team.

- __Inspection And Adaption__- 
	- Inspection characterizes the empirical Scrum nature of testing hypothesis. It is about planning and trying something, checking what happens, learning from it, and adapting.
	- In Scrum, the Scrum Artifacts and progress towards Sprint Goals must be frequently inspected. Whenever a deviation is detected outside the acceptable limits, adjustments must be made to the process itself.
	- **A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.**
	

## Scrum Values
- __Commitment__ - The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each                              other.
- __Focus__ - Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible                           progress toward these goals.
-  __Openness__ - The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the                               challenges.
- __Respect__ -  Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people,                     and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.
- __Courage__ - The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on                    tough problems.

- [[Cone of Uncertainty]] -  Concept that describes how uncertainty varies through time.
- [[Scrum Team]]
- [[Scrum Flow]]
- [[Flaccid Scrum]] - This anti-pattern reflects the behavior of teams that focus too much on delivering features as fast as possible while compromising quality. Consequently, while they achieve great velocity on the first Sprints, they suffer a lot later when dealing with the low-quality product they have produced.
