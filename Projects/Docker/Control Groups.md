• Cgroups, a Linux kernel feature, manages resources like CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and I/O among processes.  
• It enforces resource constraints on containers, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior.  
• Key features include:  
- Resource Isolation: Constricts each container to a specific set of resources, ensuring fair sharing of system resources.  
- Limiting Resources: Sets limits on system resources used by a container, preventing excessive resource consumption.  
- Prioritizing Containers: Allocates different shares of resources, giving preference to certain containers.  
- Monitoring: Offers mechanisms for monitoring resource usage of individual containers, providing insights into container performance and potential resource bottlenecks.  
• Overall, cgroups is crucial for a robust and efficient container runtime environment in Docker.
