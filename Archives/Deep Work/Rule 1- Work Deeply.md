_People fight desires all day long._

- ["] Desire turned out be the norm, not the exception.
	_Willpower_ by Roy Baumeister, John Tierney.

The five most common these subjects fought include, not surprisingly, eating, sleeping and sex. But the top five list also included desires for "taking a break from hard work ... checking email and social networking sites, surfing the web, listening to music, or watching television." Subjects succeeded in resisting internet and tv distractions only around half the time.

_You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it._

The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add _routines_ and _rituals_ to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

### Decide on your depth Philosophy

__The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling__
This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations, Practitioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that they're pursuing, and the bulk of their professional success comes form doing this one thing exceptionally well. 

- ["] The productivity equation is a non-linear one, in other words. This accounts for why I am a bad correspondent and why I very rarely accept speaking engagements. If i organize my life in such a way that i get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. But as those chunks get separated and fragmented, my productivity as novelist drops spectacularly.
	_why i am a bad correspondent_, Neal Stephenson

__The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling__
This philosophy asks that you divided your time dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically -- seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized.

The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if subject dedicates enough time tosuch endeavors to reach maximum congnitive intensity -- the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the _minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day_.

__The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling__
- ["] He keeps calendar on his wall. Every day that he writes jokes he crosses out the date on the calendar with a big red X. "After a few days you'll have a chain, Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll seeing that chain especially when you get a few wekks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain."
	_ I saw my chance. I had to ask Jerry Seinfeld if he had any tips for a young comic. What he told me was something that would benefit me for a lifetime, Brad Isaac

This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. That goal, in other words, is to  generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you're going to go deep.

Another common way to implement this philosophy is to replace the visual aid of the chain method with a set starting time that your see every day for deep work. In much the same way that maintaining visual indicators of your work progress can reduce the barrier to entry for going deep, eliminating even the simplest scheduling decisions, such as when  during the day to do the work, also reduces this barrier.

__The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling__
Fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule.

This approach is not for the deep work novice. The ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to deep mode doesn't come naturally. Without practice, such witches can seriously deplete your finite willpower reserves.

 










### Ritualize
- ["] There is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration -- that there is some strike or bolt or bubling up of creative mojo from who knows where ... but I hope (my works) makes clear that waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps the single best piece of advice. I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.
	Mason Currey

- ["] Great creative minds think like artists but work like accountants.
	David Brooks

There is no one correct deep work ritual -- the right fit depends on both the person and the type of project pursued. But there are some general questions that any effective ritual must address:
- __Where you'll work and for how long__
- __How you'll work once you start to work__
	ex- ban on any internet use
	Without structure, you'll have mentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess whether you're  working sufficiently hard.
- __How you'll support your work__
	ex - start with a cup of good coffee, light exercise as walking
	Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth.

### Make Grand Gestures
By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind's instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.

It's not just the change of environment or seeking of quiet that enables more depth. The dominant force is the psychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand.

To put yourself in an exotic location to focus on a writing project, or to take a week off from work just to think, or to lock yourself in a hotel room until you complete an important invention: these gestures push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources. Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big.
### Don't Work Alone

Express yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter.

__The whiteboard Effect__
For some types of problems, working with someone else at they proverbial shared whiteboard ca push you deeper than if you were working alone. The presence of the other party waiting for your next insight -- be it someone physically in the same room or collaborating with your virtually -- can short circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth.

Distraction remains a destroyer of depth. Therefore, the hub-and-spoke model provides a crucial template. Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations. You should try to optimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing them together into a sludge that impedes both goal, mixing them together into sludge that impeded both goals.

When you retreat to a spoke to think deeply, when it's reasonable to leverage the whiteboard effect, do so. By working side by side with someone on a problem, you can push each other toward deeper levels of depth, and therefore toward the generation of more and more valuable output as compared to working alone.



### Execute like a business

__Discipline #1: Focus on the wildly important__

"The mored you try to do, the less you actually accomplish". They elaborate that execution should be aimed at a small number of "wildly important goals". This simplicity will help focus an organization's energy to a sufficient intensity to ignite real results.

- ["] If you want to win the war for attention, don't try to say 'no' to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say 'yes' to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.
	_The art of focus_, David Brooks.

__Discipline #2: Act on the lead Measures__
Lead Measures - measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures

For an individual focus on deep work, it's easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicate toward you wildly important goal.

__Discipline #3: Keep a compelling scoreboard__

__Discipline #4: Create a cadence of accountability__
The final step to help maintain a focus on lead measures is to put in place "a rhythm of regular and frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal."

For an individual focused on his or her won deep work habit, there's likely no team to meet with, but this doesn't exempt you from the need for regular accountability. Weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead.

### Be Lazy

- ["] Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is a indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets ... it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.
	Time Kreider
	
__Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights__

Unconscious thought theory (UTT) -- an attempt to understand the different roles conscious and unconscious deliberation play in decision making. At a high level, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved.

For decisions that involve large amount of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. UTT hypothesizes that this is due to the fact that these regions of your brain have more neuronal bandwidth available, allowing them to move around more information and shift thorough more potential solutions than your conscious centers of thinking.

__Reason #2: Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply__

Attention restoration theory (ART) -- claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate.

To concentrate requires what ART calls _directed attention_. This resource is finite: If you exhaust it, you'll struggle to concentrate.

The core mechanism of this theory is the idea that you can restore the ability to direct your attention if you give the activity a rest.

Trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.

__Reason #3: The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important__

For a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration seems to be limit, while for experts this number can expand as many as four hours -- but rarely more.

The implication of these results is that your capacity for deep work in a given day is limited. If you're careful about your schedule, you should hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday.

To succeed with this strategy, you must first accept the commitment that once your workday shuts down, you can not allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention.

Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your commitment to shutting down with  a strict shutdown ritual that you use at end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed.
- You have a plan you trust for its completion.
- it's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right.

Zeigarnik Effect - Describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention.

- ["] Committing to a specific plan for a goal may therefore not only facilitate attainment of the goal but may also free cognitive resources for other pursuits.
	_Consider it done_, Roy Baumeister, E.J Masicampo.

Shutdown ritual doesn't force you to explicitly identify a plan for every single task in your task list, it does force you to capture every task in a common list, and then review these tasks before making a plan for the next day. This ritual ensures that no task will be forgetten: each will be reviewed daily and tackled when the time is appropriate. Your mind is released from its duty to keep track of these obligations at every moment -- your shutdown ritual has taken over that responsibility

__When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done.__
