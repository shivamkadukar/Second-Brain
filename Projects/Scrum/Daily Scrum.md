### Daily Scrum
- time-boxed to __15 minutes__.
- Product Owner and scrum master does not participate unless they are actively working  on items in sprint backlog.
- To be take place at same place and same time.
- the meeting focuses on __assessing the team's progress__ toward the Sprint Goal and produces __an actionable plan for the next day__ of work.

Each team member talk about -
	- what do I do yesterday to meet the sprint goal?
	- what will I do today to meet the sprint goal?
	- Do I see any impediments that prevents me or the team from meeting the sprint goal?
	- If someone is having a hard time with a task, one should make the other Developers aware during the meeting and maybe ask for help. However, it is __not the time to discuss the solution to the problem__. Often the Developers meet throughout the day for detailed discussions or to adapt the rest of the Sprint's work.

Developers can monitor the Sprint progress by tracking the total remaining work to support decision-making. For this purpose, the Developers might maintain a Sprint Burndown chart.
