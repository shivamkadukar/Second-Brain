high level language - stream of characters

- [[Lexical Analysis]] - input --> stream of characters, output --> stream of tokens
- Syntax Analysis - performs parsing, tokens converted to parse tree
- Semantic Analysis - 
- Intermediate code generation - Converts parse tree to 3 address code.
Till this point the phases are same irrespective of the operating system. after this the phases depends on the operating system.
- Code optimization - 
- Target Code Generation -
