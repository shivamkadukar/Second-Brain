Tagging should facilitate effective action, not just abstract thought. Your time and energy are much better spent thinking about how the contents of your notes can be used to advance your projects and goals.
I propose an entirely different use for tags for modern knowledge work: to track the progress of your notes. Following the same principle of actionability we’ve used as a north star throughout Building a Second Brain, we can shift the purpose of tags from classification to action and unlock profound benefits to both our productivity and creativity

We need to understand what we are trying to use our notes to accomplish to avoid the trap of “tagging for the sake of tagging.”

Ask yourself, “What are the most common use cases for the content I capture?” Here are a couple common examples: • Tagging according to the final product a note will be used in: (Presentation), (Essay), (Report), (Website), (Project plan), (Meeting agenda), or (Budget) • Tagging according to the kind of information a note contains: (Arguments), (Theories), (Frameworks), (Evidence), (Claim), (Counterpoint), or (Question)
