**Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.** Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.

**The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness.** The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. **They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.**
